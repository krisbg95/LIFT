Data and scripts to run machine learning models 
Scripts to run all modalities: Clinical.r, Functional_connectivity.r, Structural_connectivity.r, Morphometric.r, and Multimodal.r  
Data to run scripts: MLdataP_6months.RData (functional connectivity from PASAT fMRI, 6 months follow-up outcome),MLdataP_1year.RData (1 year follow-up outcome), MLdataR_6months.RData (functional connectivity from resting-state fMRI), MLdataR_1year.RData  
Results from running all scripts: Results_All_Models.RData 
Script to run comparisons between models: Model_comparisons.R 
Script to run permutation test and interpretability methods (feature importance, ALE plots, LIME models) on final multimodality model: Multimodal_interpretability.R 
Script to run validation on external data set: Validation.R 
Data for external validation: MLdataP_6months_validation.RData
